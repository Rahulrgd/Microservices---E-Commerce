# E-Commerce Web Application (May 2024 - June 2024)

Welcome to the E-Commerce Web Application project! In this repository, we've built a microservices-based application for an online store. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, the technologies used, and some key features.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Develop a scalable and modular E-Commerce platform using microservices architecture.
- **Duration:** May 2024 to June 2024
- **Key Focus Areas:**
  - Microservices design and implementation
  - Conversion of a monolithic application to microservices
  - Integration of various technologies
  - Ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability

## Technologies Used

1. **Spring Boot:** Used for building microservices due to its simplicity and robustness.
2. **MongoDB:** As our NoSQL database for storing product information, user profiles, and orders.
3. **JPA (Java Persistence API):** For managing database interactions.
4. **Kafka:** Used for asynchronous communication between microservices.
5. **Docker:** Containerization of microservices for easy deployment.
6. **Zipkin:** Distributed tracing for monitoring and debugging.
7. **Other Design Patterns:**
   - **Gateway Pattern:** Centralized entry point for all microservices.
   - **Resilience4j:** Circuit breakers and rate limiting.
   - **Client Discovery (Eureka):** Service discovery and load balancing.
   - **OpenFeign:** Declarative REST client for microservices communication.
   - **Config Microservice:** Externalizing configurations for each microservice.

## Key Features

1. **Product Catalog:**
   - Microservice responsible for managing product details, categories, and availability.
   - Supports CRUD operations for products.
   - Integrates with MongoDB for data storage.

2. **User Management:**
   - Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
   - Secure authentication using JWT tokens.
   - Stores user data in MongoDB.

3. **Order Processing:**
   - Manages user orders, cart, and checkout process.
   - Communicates with the Product Catalog microservice.
   - Kafka-based event-driven architecture for order updates.

4. **Monitoring and Tracing:**
   - Integrated Zipkin for distributed tracing.
   - Monitor service interactions and performance.

## Next Steps

1. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy microservices on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP).
   - Set up Docker containers for each service.

2. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests and integration tests for each microservice.
   - Ensure end-to-end functionality.

3. **Scalability:**
   - Optimize microservices for scalability.
   - Consider load balancing and auto-scaling.
